# Recursive & Backtracking Visualizations with Manim

This repository contains a collection of animations demonstrating classic recursion and backtracking algorithms using the Manim Community library.


## Features

### Recursion
- **Sierpinski Triangle**: Visualize the construction of the Sierpinski fractal via recursive subdivision.
- **Dragon Curve Fractal**: Animate the generation of the dragon curve through recursive folding.
- **Binary Tree**: Show recursive tree growth with customizable depth and branching factors.

### Backtracking
- **N-Queens**: Step through the backtracking process used to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.

## Installation

### Required libraries

```bash
pip install manim numpy
```

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gulia1001/Recursion-Backtracking-Manim
cd manim-recursion-backtracking
```


###
```bash
manim {file_name}.py {class} -pqh
```

### Options:

- **p:** automatically play the video file when done

- **q:** quality (l = low, m = medium, h = high)
